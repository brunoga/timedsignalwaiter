# timedsignalwaiter

TimedSignalWaiter carves out a niche by providing a reusable, broadcast-style synchronization primitive with integrated timeouts, without requiring manual lock management or complex channel replacement logic from the user.

When would you use this instead of raw channels?

* You need reusable broadcast signals (not just one-off).

* You want built-in timeouts for waiting on these signals without writing select statements everywhere.

* You want to hide the complexity of managing channel lifecycles for reusability.

And when would you use this instead of sync.Cond?

* You absolutely need timeouts on your wait operation (this is the primary driver).

* The condition being waited for is a simple "event happened" rather than a complex predicate on shared data.

* You want to avoid manual sync.Locker management.

* You only need broadcast semantics.

Essentially, TimedSignalWaiter offers a higher-level abstraction over a common pattern that, if implemented manually with channels or sync.Cond (especially with timeouts for Cond), would be more verbose and error-prone.
